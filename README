CLFN Fonts is a replacement of original ChuLyuFonts, which I made in 2021 - 2022.
The kbitx file is the source code. Open via Bits'N'Picas by Kreative Korp <github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas>
The woff2 file is hosted for CDNs to let users use it - only around 1MB!
(Only Simplified Chinese version, sorry)
